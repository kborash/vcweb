(General Instructions)

This experiment is part of vcweb designed to conduct research with the goal to evaluate the impact of different policies on collective action in regard to investments in public goods. In this case, the experiment concerns the maintainance of a resource that is subject to pollution, which we refer to as a 'sanitation game'.

By participaint you will be assigned to a group that shares a virtual resource which you need to maintain free of pollution. The resource is represented by a text-file which containts text discussing public health and sanitation. The pollution is represented by {{consent.1}} symbols. On an {{consent.3}} schedule, more {{consent.1}} symbols are added. The objective to remove the pollution represent by the {{consent.1}} symbols and keep it clean from pollution. Less symbols means a cleaner resource.

The resource maybe clean or dirty depending on the activity of your group. In order to keep the resource clean you will have to return to this site to check it over the course of the experiment which lasts {{consent.2}}

We hope our study will increase the understanding of policies that increase the dissemination of sanitation. 

Vcweb maintains your confidentiality during the experiment by vcweb and after the experiment by the experiment proctor. Your entire activity during the sanitation game is confidential.

If you have any questions concerning the research study, please contact the research team at: (Marco Janssen, Marco.Janssen@asu.edu).

There are no foreseeable risks or discomforts to your participation.
