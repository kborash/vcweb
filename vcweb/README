Dependencies:
    Python 2.6:
    (either run as root or inside a virtualenv)
    fabric 0.9.2+:

    RabbitMQ (maybe)

Steps to install:
1. download and install easy_install
2. easy_install pip
3. pip install virtualenv (if you don't want to muck up your base python system)
4. pip install fabric
5. fab setup (change default settings in fabfile.py as necessary; eventually I should make this configurable)
6. fab syncdb
7. fab server (in one terminal)
8. fab tornadio (in another terminal) if you want to run vcweb w/ server push enabled.

To start up celeryd and celerybeat

./manage.py celeryd
./manage.py celerybeat

(or fab celeryd / celerybeat)
