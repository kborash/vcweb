            Welcome to the Virtual Commons Web Environment, an open software initiative hosted at
            <a class='external' href='http://www.asu.edu'>Arizona State University</a>.
            We develop real-time dynamic experiments to help us analyze and understand issues related 
            to the governance of common resources. Sharing common resources has been a challenge for 
            human societies for millennia. In many circumstances, the ability to create effective institutional 
            arrangements has helped avoid the tragedy of the commons. Controlled experiments have been instrumental 
            in increasing our understanding of how humans organize themselves in cooperative arrangements to govern 
            common resources.

            This application is still under active development and in its alpha stage.  This means that <b>any data you create on this website will
                not be preserved.</b> Once we reach a public beta we will ensure that your data is maintained and migrated.

            Current development is focused on the <a class='external' href='http://vcweb.asu.edu/devfoot'>Lighter Footprints</a> HTML 5 mobile application 
            (also usable in the latest builds of <a class='external' href='http://www.google.com/chrome'>Chrome</a> and <a class='external' href='http://www.apple.com/safari'>Safari</a>).
            We are also planning to convert our <a class='external' href='http://commons.asu.edu/papers'>field experiments on water, forests, and fisheries</a>
            into web-based experiments, starting with the <a href='{% url forestry:index %}'>forestry experiment</a>.
