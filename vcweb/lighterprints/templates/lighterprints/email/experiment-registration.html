The experiment will begin on {{experiment.start_date}} at midnight and run for {{experiment.number_of_rounds}} days, ending at
midnight, {{experiment.end_date}}. If your group's average points per person reaches 160 points of carbon footprint savings,
everyone in the group will earn 1 extra credit point. Every day your group reaches 160 points will result in 1 extra
credit point being awarded to each member of your group, so you can earn 5 extra credit points total. 
</p>

<p>
Each day at midnight your group's score will reset to 0.
