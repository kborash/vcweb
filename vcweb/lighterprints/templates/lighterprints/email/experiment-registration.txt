The experiment will run from Monday, April 8th until midnight on Friday, April 12th.  There are three levels to
this experiment, and your group must reach specific average carbon footprint savings in order to advance to the next
level.  This will be explained in more detail when you visit the website.

The probability of earning $100 is based on the performance of your group:

    * If your group completes level 3 by midnight on Wednesday, April 10th, your group has a 20% chance to earn $100
    * If your group completes level 3 by midnight on Thursday, April 11th, your group has a 14% chance to earn $100
    * If your group completes level 3 by midnight on Friday, April 12th, your group has a 8% chance to earn $100
    * If your group completes level 2 by midnight on Friday, April 12th, your group has a 4% chance to earn $100
    * If your group completes level 1 by midnight on Friday, April 12th, your group has a 2% chance to earn $100
    * If your group does not complete level 1 by midnight on Friday, April 12th, your group will still have a 1% chance to earn $100
