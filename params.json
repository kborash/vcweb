{"name":"Virtual Commons","tagline":"collective action experiments in Django","body":"The Virtual Commons is an open software initiative affiliated with the [Center for the Study of Institutional Diversity](http://csid.asu.edu) for computational social science. We develop real-time and web-based experiments to help us analyze and understand collective action issues. Examples of collective action issues range from the sharing of common resources, which has been a challenge for human societies for millennia (e.g., fisheries, forests, irrigation systems) to the development of public goods such as <a href='http://www.wikipedia.org'>Wikipedia</a>. In many circumstances, the ability to create effective institutional arrangements has helped avoid the tragedy of the commons. Controlled behavioral experiments have been instrumental in increasing our understanding of how humans organize themselves in cooperative arrangements to govern common resources.\r\n\r\nIf you're interested in our research, would like to contribute to our open source software development efforts, or have any questions, please feel free to [contact us](http://vcweb.asu.edu/contact).","google":"UA-321755-7","note":"Don't delete this file!
