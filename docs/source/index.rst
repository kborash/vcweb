The Virtual Commons Web Environment (VCWEB)
===========================================
The Virtual Commons Web Environment is a Django web application and framework designed to facilitate the development of
interactive web-based experiments for social scientists interested in group behavior. It currently supports two types
of round based experiments:

    * *controlled experiments* conducted within a computer lab where an experimenter controls the transition from one round to the next
    * *long-running experiments* where one day corresponds to a single round and round advancement occurs automatically at midnight
